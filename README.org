This software computes the eigendecomposition of the Laplace-Beltrami
operator on the charts of a Riemannian manifold. It uses finite elements via
the FEniCS computing platform (version 2019.1.0) as well as the eigenvalue
solvers in the SLEPc library. The user can specify an arbitrary metric tensor
by writing its entries as valid C expressions.
